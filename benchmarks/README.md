  * -Xmx8g
  * -Xmx250m
In addition, the following parameters have been applied
  * -server
  * -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
    
## Benchmark execution
    
The benchmarks consist of a set of 4 queries processed by 3 different query frameworks:
  * Eclipse OCL
  * EMF-IncQuery
  * Mogwai
The databases storing the models are constructed the first time the benchmarks is launched. This might take some time, depending on your system configuration. It is recommanded to use a large JVM to avoid garbage collection problems during the database creation.
